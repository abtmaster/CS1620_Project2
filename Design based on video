I just started and project is at the very beginning

Lab 2 has number of students but app works with one
student at a time

Input:  Student name - check it is not empty
        Number of attempts - check between 1 to 4
        Score - check it is between 0 and 100

Submit Button

Grade logic is similar to Lab 2

Validation: Score must be between 0 and 100

Produce message to user

Store results in CSV file, CSV File will be like in the video

MVC model will be similar to project 1

i will design GUI using QT Designer
convert it to python file using pyuic6
pyuic6 -x grading.ui -o grading_view.py

this will be View, it cannot be changed manually

then i will create
controller.py that connects GUI and model

and main.py to run the application
